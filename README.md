# Steel-Beam-Design-Analysis-Civil-Engineering-Assessment-Using-AutoCAD
This repository documents a structural engineering assessment focused on the design and analysis of simply supported steel I-beams under uniformly distributed loads (UDL). The project includes hand calculations, AutoCAD designs, software verification using TIE Beam, and a detailed cost estimation section .

📄 Project Overview
This civil engineering project evaluates the performance of a 360 UB 50.7 section (Grade 350 steel) in response to loading conditions commonly found in building and infrastructure applications. The report addresses:
Flexural and shear capacity |
Bearing strength |
Structural adequacy under UDL |
Economical feasibility through cost breakdown

🔍 Project Scenarios
🧪 Occasion 1: Section Properties & Elastic Modulus |
Hand calculations for second moment of area (I) and elastic section modulus (Ze) |
Geometry specifications extracted from beam section (depth, flange/web dimensions) |
AutoCAD design with dimensional annotations |
All calculations verified with TIE Beam software

📊 Occasion 2: Structural Load Capacity (Shear, Bending, Bearing)
Analysis of:
Nominal section moment capacity (Ms) |
Shear capacity (Vu, Vv) |
Bearing yield and buckling capacities (Rby, Rbb) |

Includes:
Shear Force Diagram |
Bending Moment Diagram |
All results validated via software and design code compliance

📐 Design Assets
📝 Hand calculations (scanned or PDF format) |
📷 AutoCAD screenshots of the I-beam with full dimensions |
📊 Diagrams for shear and bending moment profiles |
🧮 Section property computations and comparison to code-based limits

💰 Cost Estimation Section
A comprehensive breakdown of project costs including:
Materials (structural steel quantities & rates) |
Manpower (fabricators, welders – with daily rates) |
Equipment (welding machines, cranes) |
Indirect Costs (overhead, utilities, admin) |
All items formatted in tabular structure for clarity and professional use.
